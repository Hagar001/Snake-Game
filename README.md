# 🐍 Snake Game  

A classic Snake Game built in Python as part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.  

This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts, including OOP (object-oriented programming), game loops, event handling, and collision detection, while using the **turtle graphics module**.  

---

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to move the snake.  
- Eat the **food** (white dot) to grow longer.  
- Avoid hitting the **walls** or your own **tail**.  
- The score increases by 1 point for every food eaten.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Snake grows in length when eating food.  
- Scoreboard that updates in real-time.  
- Game over detection on collisions.  
- Replay option after game over.  
- Built with **Python’s built-in Turtle graphics**, so no extra libraries required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Graphics Library:** turtle (standard library)
